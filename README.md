# jQuery to React App Migration

This project involves migrating a jQuery-based To-do App to React. The goal is to rewrite the application's code using React and leverage its advantages, such as component-based architecture and state management.

## Challenge

The challenge was to migrate the jQuery application to React while maintaining the core functionality and improving the code structure. The following changes were made:

- Replacing jQuery with React and utilizing functional components.
- Using the useState hook to manage state within components.
- Converting event handlers to React's synthetic event system.
- Adapting the UI markup to JSX syntax.

## Features

- Adding tasks: Users can enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button to add it to the task list.
- Toggling task completion: Clicking on a task toggles its completion status, which updates the styling accordingly.

## Technologies Used

- React
- JSX
- CSS
